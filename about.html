            <h1>
                I'm Jonathan Lewis from Albuquerque New Mexico. I moved to Phoenix Arizona in 2016 to persue Eletrical Engineering at ASU Fulton School of Engineering.
                At the time my basic C++ class made no sence to me but I knew enough to get throgh the course but i thought this wasn''t for me. 
                A few semesters in I leared about ASU's video game development courses and found a love and understanding for programming. This lead to me changing my major from Electrical Engineering to Computer Scrience.
                My Computer Science courses foucused primarily on Software Development, I took COURSES .,.,..,., .... ... ect which helped build my understanding of the software development process. 
                For my senior capstone project I worked with a team and sponsor to develop a mobile application for iOS devices using React Native Express.
                I worked primarily on frontend development for the project. We worked with a design team that would provide us figma models of the appliction of us to devlop.
